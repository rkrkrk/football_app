 <h1>HELP - SETUP screen </h1>
 <p>
 This screen is used to enter match details, and make/save team selection.<br/><br/>
 By default, the team selection from the last match is retained so you can edit
 it rather than start from scratch. To clear the team selection long press the <b>
 reset team</b> button.
 <br/><br/>You select 15 players and up to 10 subs. 
 </p>
 <p>
Enter <i><b>Date, Opposition Team name</i> and <i>Location</i></b> at top of the screen. Own team 
name defaults to the current panel name.  To change it go into the manage panel section.
</p>
 <p>
To select the team, touch on one of the position buttons.  This will display a list of 
players on your panel. Swipe/scroll, if necessary, to see all players and touch one to select.  
Repeat for all the positions and subs.<br/><br/>

It is not necessary to select a player for all or any of the positions, you can just leave the 
number if you prefer.
</p>
<p>
 When you are finished, touch the <b>save starting team</b> button to save the starting lineup.
<br/><br/>You can only save starting team once. You will get a message if you try again. 
Quit back out to <b>start screen</b> and <b>start new match</b> again if you want to enter 
a new team selection.
 </p>
 <p>
To make a postion change or substitution use the -SWAP- item in the panel list. For example: to
substitute the goalkeeper: <br/>• touch the goalkeeper position button and select -SWAP- from the 
list of players. <br/>•This will remove the goalkeepers name  onto the list of players and insert
 -SWAP- into the team lineup. <br/>•Then touch on the button of the sub you want to use. 
 <br/>•Select the goalkeepers name from the list of players. <br/>•This will remove the subs 
 name onto the list of players and swap in the goalkeepers name as the sub. <br/>• Now touch
 on the goalkeeper position button and select the subs name from the list of players.<br/>•
 This will swap the subs name into the team line up and remove -SWAP- to the list of players
 again.<br/>•touch the <b>make change</b> button to save the 
 change.<br/><br/>
  
 The same procedure applies to making postion changes - swap in -SWAP- to take a player out, 
 swap that player into their new position, put the player swapped out of that position back 
 into the first position instead of -SWAP- and touch the <b>make change</b> button to save the 
 change.<br/><br/>
 
 After making a substitution or position change, touch the <b>make change</b> button to save 
 the changes.
